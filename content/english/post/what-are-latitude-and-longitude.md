Latitude & Longitude - These are imaginary lines drawn on the globe.

<img src="../../../images/post/earth/latitudes-and-longitudes.png" alt="latitudes and longitudes" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br><br>

Lines running east and west, parallel to the equator - These are called Lines/Parallels of ***latitude***. 

Lines running north and south passing through the poles - These are called Lines/Meridians of ***longitude*** 

The  intersection of latitude and longitude pin-points any place on the earth’s surface.

## Latitude

Latitude - ***angular distance*** (in degrees) of a point on the earth's surface ***from the centre of the earth***.

* Latitude lines or Parallels are parallel to the equator. 
* They are circles which get smaller polewards. 
* The equator represents 0° and the North and South Poles are 90°N and 90°S.
* Average linear distance of a degree of latitude = 69 miles (111 km)
* As the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, the linear distance of a degree of latitude at the pole is a little longer than that at the equator. 
* Each degree is sub-divided into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds. 

### The most important lines of latitude:

## Longitude

Longitude - ***angular distance*** (in degrees) of a place east or west of the ***Prime Meridian***.

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Prime Meridian / Greenwich Meridian</b><br>

Zero meridian (0°) passes through the Royal Astronomical Observatory at Greenwich, near London.
</div> 

All other meridians radiate eastward and westwards up to 180° from Prime Meridian.

* Lines of longitude/Meridians are a series of semi-circles that run from pole to pole (in a north-south direction) passing through the equator at right angles.
* Unlike latitudes, they are all equal in length. 
* 1° of longitude = 69.1 miles at the equator and 1° of longitude = 0 miles at the poles. 
* They determine local time in relation to Greenwich Mean Time (G.M.T.)/World Time.


## Coordinates

The combination of meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude establishes a <strong>framework or grid</strong>. 

Using this grid we can determine exact positions of any place <strong>in reference to the Prime meridian and the Equator</strong>. 

To provide a geographic location of a place using latitude and longitude - <strong>Coordinates</strong> are used.   

* The latitude has the symbol of phi (Φ) & the longitude has the symbol of lambda (λ). 
<img src="../../../images/post/earth/coordinates.png" alt="coordinates" style="width:90%;height:90%;">

* Latitude is always written first.

For example:<br>
A point - 40° N, 30° E <br>
It will be located 40° north of the Equator and 30° east of the Prime meridian.

To be even more precise - we should use minutes, and seconds along with degrees. <br> 
A point - 40° 35′ 26′′ N,  30° 12′ 38′′ E
